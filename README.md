# My Internet Of Things - miot

A simple but complete Web platform for you to create IoT / Physical Web oriented content. Beacons can provide an 
additive second-screen experience for visitors in a lot of contexts or places. This platform allows you to easily 
create optimized content for mobile devices with different templates and layouts. That means : you can propose a 
unique experience for users / visitors / curious people by defining places, events and points of interest and 
attach attractive content to it.

## Physical Web, feed it with good content

The concept of the Physical Web is to stream simple URLs using Beacons. The main advantage is that users do not need a specific
app anymore. This technology is supported by default on Android devices, all you need is to have a Beacon configured to stream your
URL and you are ready to go !

The question is what URL do I stream with my Beacon ? What content will be attached to my point of interest ?

A wikipedia page ? - _Nah, it's too technical and basique_

A youtube video ? - _Meh, you don't know if they will watch it... and it's too loudy_

A website homepage ? - _Totally out of context_

**What about a good miot Physical Web optimized page ? - Great idea !**
